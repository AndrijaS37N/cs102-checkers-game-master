<h3>Project boot + A short personal note. 🏴</h3>
<p>Made in NetBeans IDE, modified in IntelliJ IDEA. 
Run the Main.java class in the source dir or build a JAR file in your IDE and run it instead.
It was interesting checking out a project that I made back when I had just started learning engineering.
Woo!
