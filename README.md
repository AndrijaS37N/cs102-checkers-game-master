<h3>A simple freshman Java project with the following characteristics:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Made during the CS102 course - Objects & Data Abstraction</li>
  <li>JavaFX graphics and animations</li>
  <li>A MySQL database</li>
  <li>Somewhat clunky beginner code</li>
  <li>A music component that plays "Vide Cor Meum" - Patrick Cassidy</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal note:</p>
<p>Made in NetBeans IDE, modified in IntelliJ IDEA. It was interesting and actually exciting checking out a project that I made back when I had just started learning engineering.</p>
